Ectopia
=======

Whitepaper
----------

#### By Hilal Agil

### This paper outlines plans for a decentralized, self-sustainable ecosystem that aims to create secure, sustainable and inclusive habitats.

Problem
-------

#### Climate Crisis

90% of the world’s largest cities are situated on the waterfront. By
2050, over 570 low-lying coastal cities will face projected sea level
rise by at least 0.5 meters.^1^ By 2030, a projected 27% of people
worldwide will be concentrated in cities with at least 1 million
inhabitants.^2^

#### Access to Natural Resources

2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed drinking
water services.^4^

#### Socioeconomic Inequality

1 billion people lack proof of identity. There are over 1.7 billion
people globally who are unbanked or underserved with respect to
financial services.^3^ Income inequality continues to be on the rise in
many countries around the world, the richest 1% now hold a larger
percentage of national income than ever before.

Opportunity
-----------

-   Countries that are threatened by the climate crisis should have an
    accessible way to rebuild and preserve their habitats while
    maintaining their cultural heritage. The habitats of the future
    should be climate-positive.
-   Innovative models and technology exists to design new sustainable
    ecosystems, financial systems, societies and create equal economic
    opportunities for everybody.
-   People have a right to protect their privacy and access information
    freely. People have lost trust in centralized forms of governance
    and corporate monopoly.

Introducing Ectopia {#ectopia}
-------------------

We need an ecosystem that can deliver on the promise of circular
economies, decentralization and financial independence.

Advances in technology and new innovative models have made it practical
to explore new approaches for infrastructure design, circular economies,
new societal designs, innovative financial systems, secure digital
networks to help the transition towards a more sustainable future and
create new economic opportunities for everybody. Academic institutions,
non-profit organizations, teams, and individuals around the world are
passionately working towards achieving these goals. I believe that
integrating these concepts into one ecosystem can accelerate the
transition to the sustainable future we are all working towards.

Building new sustainable ecosystems should be simpler and more
accessible. Ectopic framework will be made freely available for
designing and building innovative ecosystems, societies, and economies
to lower the barriers to access for everybody and promote innovation.

The initial design proposed for the ecosystem may sound like a project
aimed for the premium market. And the question would be how that can
solve the challenges being described here. Research and Development is
expensive when it comes to the initial development of new technologies
and models.

By targeting the high end market, the project will be attractive to
investors who are prepared to pay a premium to gain access to new and
innovative solutions. Designing more affordable scalable models of these
components will be possible once the first models are designed and
tested successfully.

### The plan:

-   Design a sustainable ecosystem built around cutting edge technology.
-   Use those learnings to design more scaled down and affordable
    ecosystems.
-   Design even more affordable and stripped down ecosystems.

#### Ectopia is made up of eight parts that works together as a framework to create sustainable and inclusive ecosystems:

1.  It has a stable, independent, circular economic model.
2.  It is built around a secure, decentralized blockchain based digital
    ecosystem.
3.  It has a societal design with a flat social hierarchy that
    guarantees equality for all.
4.  It has a modular and scalable infrastructure design.
5.  It can generate clean and renewable energy.
6.  It can produce unlimited fresh water and food in any environment.
7.  It uses design materials produced from waste for manufacturing.
8.  It uses zero emission, shared autonomous transportation systems.

Ectopic Labs {#labs}
------------

Independent R&D hubs called Ectopic Labs will be setup globally with the
mission to do research and development to achieve the Ectopic vision and
to promote sustainability and inclusion. Ectopic Labs will collaborate
with researchers, academic institutions and organizations working on
solutions that contribute to the research and development of Ectopia’s
components to accelerate the development of the ecosystem and foster
innovation.

For these partners, the lab provides them with a unique environment to
access resources that makes it easier for them to solve problems and
identify opportunities in a real-world setting. Through a combination of
research, prototyping and trial and error, the lab will aim to be a
global hub for testing potential solutions to some of the world’s most
pressing challenges.

Administrative Structure {#structure}
------------------------

The ecosystem is designed to be setup under an existing governing
structure, an autonomous community, city or even as a sovereign state.

#### Advisory Boards

Independent advisory bodies which consists of experts, partners,
multilateral organizations, and academic institutions.

#### Founders

Parties that invest in building Ectopic ecosystems. Governments,
financial institutions, individuals, nonprofit and multilateral
organizations or the combination of two or more of these parties could
serve as founders.

#### Partners

Intergovernmental organizations, governments, financial institutions.

#### The Board

The Board will be an oversight body of the State that represents the
Founders and Partners, to provide operational support for the State.

#### State

The governing body for each of the Ectopic ecosystems which is comprised
of representatives from each of the cities and an observer from the
Board.

#### City

A council comprised of representatives from the neighborhoods that
provides operational support at city level. Operational and policy
decisions of the council require various voting limitations depending on
the importance of the decision that is being made.

#### Neighborhood

A council comprised of representatives from the community members that
provides operational support for the neighborhood.

Tocen
-----

A financial system built around a digital currency called Ectocen.
Ectocen currency will be linked to decentralized economies that uses a
complementary currency called Tocens that are backed by reserves called
Vaults. The Vault will be administered by a Board that consists of
Founders of the State. An independent not-for-profit organization called
the Tocen Assembly will be setup to oversee the Ectocen currency.

#### Ectocen Currency

Ectocen will be an independent digital currency backed by the Ectopic
economies. Ectocen’s value will be linked to the decentralized portfolio
of Ectopic economies. Ectocen will aim to solve the inefficiencies
associated with current financial systems by making it cheaper, faster
and secure to transmit funds across borders. Tocen and Ectocen
currencies will use a digital wallets called Crates.

#### Tocen Assembly

An oversight body for the Ectocen currency that consists of experts and
representatives from internationally recognized bodies and Ectopic
States. The Ectocen Assembly will coordinate with relevant international
organizations, central banks and standard-setting bodies to minimize
risks and integrate the Ectocen currency into existing financial
frameworks.

#### The Vault

The Vault's initial reserve will be made up of commitments made by the
Founders and Residents. These commitments will be in the form of fiat
money or exchange-traded commodities like precious metals. Founders will
be paid out by the State to cover their investments. Residents will
receive incentives in Ectocen currency for their contributions to the
economy. Residents will not be able to directly interact with the Vault.
Representatives authorized by the Board will be the only entities that
can transact large amounts from the Vault. The Vault will invest in
assets that can generate interest over time. The revenue from this
interest will be used to support the operating expenses of the State,
invest in the Tocen global economy, growth, research and development of
Ectopic ecosystems, grants to nonprofits and academic institutions, etc.

#### Tocens

A complementary currency used within Ectopic States that will be used to
trade locally. The value of Tocens will be linked to fiat currencies or
a portfolio of assets linked to the Vault to maintain a stable value.
Each State will have their own version of Tocens backed by the Vault.
There has to be a purchase that is equivalent in fiat money or
exchange-traded commodities and transfer those to the Vault for new
Tocens to be created. The value of Tocens may fluctuate as the value of
the underlying assets shift.

Singularity
-----------

A decentralized and secure digital ecosystem that is built on
Blockchain. A universally accessible, self-sovereign identity called the
Singular Identity will be used to let people be in control of their
identities and information.

#### Decentralized Computing Network

The Singularity will make up the backbone of Ectopic digital ecosystems.
The system will use a decentralized computing network as an alternative
to traditional cloud computing. Singularity will be designed to be more
secure and private compared with the systems that are in use today. The
architecture will be highly scalable and support a decentralized storage
system that uses blockchain technology. The system will provide users
with access to a private internet-like network that has its own app
ecosystem.

#### Singular Key

A cryptographically secured universal authentication system used to
access the Singularity and other resources within the Ectopic ecosystem.
A unique pattern will be created for each resident that allows simple
and secure authentication to access the systems. The Singular Key uses a
two-step verification process for authentication, removing the need for
separate authentication for each application as well as the security
limitations associated with password-based logins.

#### Singular Identity

A self-sovereign verifiable digital identity created on the Blockchain
and managed by the Singularity system. The system will be designed to
let anybody digitize their existing identities like passports, drivers
license, and other credentials into a single secure and portable
identity.

#### An Immersive User Interface

Singularity will use a whole new kind of user interface that leverages
Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality technologies to give the user a
fully immersive experience.

#### Singularity will aim to be:

-   An opensource, independent, secure, decentralized blockchain based
    system.
-   Able to scale without limitations, have low latency and support
    high-capacity storage.
-   Able to protect the ecosystem from cyber attacks.
-   Enable the secure administration of the Ectopic governance policies,
    Tocen digital currency systems, transportation networks, robotics
    networks, energy generation systems and community resources.

A new kind of society designed around a reputation system that uses a
flat social hierarchy that guarantees food, shelter and equality for
all. Innovative models will be used for healthcare, education and to
preserve cultural heritage.

#### Reputation System

A system that will be used to calculate the social and economic
contributions to the community by Residents. This system will enable
Residents to maintain a social status within the community.

#### Livability

Shared spaces and amenities will increase human interaction and promote
a sense of belonging. Artificial beaches and lagoons will be designed
and engineered to improve livability, raising the happiness index.

#### Healthcare

The healthcare system will use more personalized and accessible methods
and will make the services available to each Resident of the community.
Innovative healthcare models like precision medicine in combination with
robotics and artificial intelligence will be practiced for more
efficiency.

#### Education

Project Based Learning will be the main education system. The classrooms
will use more interactive methods that makes use of Augmented Reality
and Mixed Reality technologies. More focus on teamwork and portfolio
assignments will be encouraged. The curriculum will be streamlined with
gamified environments to let students apply their knowledge in a
real-world like setting and gain points that would convert into grades.
Access to education will be available to all Residents of the community.

#### Culture and Historical Heritage

Mixed Reality and Augmented Reality technologies will be used to
reimagine arts, recreation, entertainment, to preserve and celebrate
cultural heritage. Designated areas for city and town squares for social
gatherings will promote a social culture.

Hive
----

A lego-like modular design framework that can be used to design
infrastructures for communities, cities and states. The framework will
use sustainable building materials and can be built on both land and
water.

#### Modular Design

A Modular Design Framework that consists of structures that can be laid
out in any formation that can be scaled without limitations. The designs
will use off site prefabrication, standardizing the design components to
make it universally adaptable. Attention will be given to reducing
building energy consumption when these structures are produced.

#### Resilient Engineering

The framework will be engineered to allow it to be constructed in both
water and on land. The structures will combine urban engineering and
bioengineering techniques to be resilient from natural disasters. The
infrastructure will use sensors and cameras to monitor the environments
to improve the quality of life of both the infrastructure and the
residents. Use of new 2D materials in combination with cutting-edge
technology will be explored when designing building materials to gain
more practical and innovative use of the infrastructure.

#### Social and Environmentally Conscious Design

The neighborhoods will be designed for accessibility with low-rise
structures that allow natural light and airflow. Neighborhoods will not
exceed more than 150 residents and will have designated areas for
social, business and mixed-use within close proximity for more
residential efficiency.

#### Sustainable Materials

Sustainable building materials will be used as much as possible while
relying on new 2D materials to explore innovative methods to gain a
higher quality of resilience and livability.

#### Smart Housing Units

Housing units will be constructed off site. Multiple design options will
be available to provide options for size and functionality of these
units. For smaller units, robotic furniture will be used for maximum use
of the space.

Grid
----

A decentralized power generation system that uses microgrids to produce
energy from renewable resources like sunlight, wind, tides and waves.
The network will use an open design to help share and track energy usage
globally.

#### Renewable Energy

Energy will be produced from renewable resources like sunlight, wind,
tides and waves. Additional methods like processing or treating waste to
generate electricity and/or heat or as a fuel source will be explored.

#### Microgrids

Decentralized microgrids will make up the power systems of Ectopia. Open
source software will be used to access more cost effective, efficient,
sustainable, and distributed energy resources. Energy usage information
from the ecosystem will be shared anonymously with open systems
operating globally to help keep track of energy usage around the world.

Farm
----

A farming system that uses urban farming technologies like Hydroponics,
Aeroponics and Aquaponics. The system will be computerized and automated
using Artificial Intelligence. Farm can produce year-round harvest in
any environment.

Nature reserves will be designed to preserve and restore forestry,
wetlands, wildlife and marine life.^5^

#### Hydroponics

The process of growing plants without using soil, which might sound
counterintuitive to anyone unfamiliar with the practice. Plants are
rooted into a variety of compounds, including vermiculite, rockwool, or
clay pellets – inert substances that won’t introduce any elements into
the plant’s environment. Nutrient-enriched water then feeds the
plant.^5^

#### Aeroponics

The process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the
use of soil. Aaeroponic systems provide the right amount of water and
nutrients, with temperature and humidity constantly fine-tuned, so that
each crop has the perfect growing conditions.^6^

#### Aquaponics

Refers to systems that combine aquaculture with hydroponics in a
symbiotic environment. Fish waste fertilizes the plants, which clean and
filter the water before it goes back into the planters; excess drips
into the fish tanks.^7^

Factory
-------

A sustainable manufacturing engineering framework that relies on zero
waste systems. Everything from infrastrctures, furniture, clothing to
household objects will be designed from sustainable materials.

#### Zero Waste Systems

Robotics and AI will be used to sort waste collected from households and
from the rest of the ecosystem. The process will be fully automated.

#### Sustainable Materials

Sustainable Design Materials will be used for manufacturing and
construction. Design and alternative materials will be produced using
recycled plastics, metals, glass, and biowaste.

#### Experimental Materials

Nanotechnology and 2D Materials will be testing and used to design next
generation smart manufacturing and construction materials.

Engine
------

A transportation network connected by zero emission, shared and
autonomous systems. From regional high speed train systems capable of
reaching 1200 miles an hour to local commuting with passenger drones,
cargo drones, shuttles to scooters.

#### Mobility

All transportation units will be powered using clean energy.
Point-to-point transit systems will use self-driving technologies and
digital navigation. Shared transportation systems like passenger drones,
shuttles, train systems, will be used for convenience and improved
safety.

Cargo transportation will rely on non-invasive methods like cargo drones
and underground hyperloop systems.
